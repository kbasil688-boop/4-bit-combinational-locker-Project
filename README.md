4-Bit Combinational Locker
A digital logic and hardware prototype developed out of personal interest to explore the intersection of theoretical logic and physical circuit implementation.

🚀 Project Status: In Active Development
Note: I am currently refining this project to achieve 100% logic accuracy across all bits. While several logic results are currently successful, I am iteratively updating the hardware to resolve signal discrepancies and improve reliability.

🛠 Project Overview
This project is an independent exploration of digital security systems. The goal is to design and build a functional physical locker that validates a specific 4-bit binary sequence using combinational logic.

My Role & Contributions
As the lead for logic design and physical construction, my responsibilities include:

Logic Architecture: Designing the gate-level logic (AND, OR, NOT) required for sequence validation.

Physical Assembly: Breadboarding the system using integrated circuits (ICs) and manual tactile inputs.

Troubleshooting: Analyzing hardware behavior to identify where physical circuits deviate from simulated logic.

🧠 Technical Skills Applied
Combinational Logic Design: Utilizing Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps for logic minimization.

Hardware Interfacing: Hands-on experience with 74-series logic gates and breadboard power management.
🧠 Sequential Logic & Memory
D-Type Flip-Flops: Implemented D-Type Flip-Flops (such as the SN74F74N) to manage state transitions and bit storage.

Engineering Persistence: Applying a growth mindset to solve complex hardware "bugs" through iterative testing.

📈 Academic Context
I am currently a third-year Electrical & Computer Engineering student at the University of Cape Town in 2026. This project serves as a practical application of the concepts I have mastered as a 2025 Dean’s List recipient and an EBE Faculty Peer Mentor.
